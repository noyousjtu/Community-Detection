Dear Prof. Shao,

     I am a 1st year phd student in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

     Currently, I am pending on a project related with graph clustering. And impressed by your paper "Community Detection based Distance Dynamics" in kdd2015, I try to implement it in the project.
     
     However, I have some puzzles, could you please give me some comments?
     1. I could not get the result in Figure 3(b) from Figure3(a) in your paper even manually.
     2. For Algorithms 1 Attractor, I am confused by line 2 to line 11 related to initialization of distances.
     For the above two questions, I have detailed explanation in the attachment.
     
     Besides, toward the sin function, I am not sure the unit of parameter. I wonder whether it is angle or radian. I assume it radian in my computation.

     Finally, could you please provide us with the source code for our better understanding of your paper?
     
     Thanks for your help. Look forward to your reply.
